         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>The city of Kerma, otherwise known as Dukki Gel, was once the capitol city of Kerman Culture between 2500 and 1500 BC. The group originated from Sudanese Nubia and was part of the Kush Kingdom who often rivaled with the New and Middle Kingdoms of Egypt. The city was once situated between the fourth and fifth cataracts (i.e. shallow lengths broken by small boulders) of the Nile River in present day Sudan territory. Archaeologists have theorized that Kerman Society became apparent in the beginning of the third millennium BC near the third cataract of the Nile. The society was cultivated and expanded initially due to the work of cattle farmers. At it’s prime, Kerma’s territory extended as far north as the impressive Eygyptian fortress of Semna, located on the second cataract of the nile, and as far south as Mograt Island. Archaeological sites at Kerma have unearthed decades of substantial research opportunities and excavations. The former includes countless numbers of grave sites, individual tombs, and living quarters of the inhabiting people. Kerma was once one of the greatest archaeological sites in Ancient Nubia. </p>

<h3>Geography and Setting</h3>
<hr>
<p>Kerma is located beyond the third cataract of the Nile, just off the Eastern bank of the the river. Due to it’s proximity to the water, the city’s soil is some of the most fertile and favorable of the Upper Nubian territory. Because of Kerma’s profitable placement, the city became the center of economics and culture within the area occupied by Ancient Egyptians otherwise known as Kush. 
The Abri-Delgo stretch of the Nile is positioned just above the city of Kerma, located almost two-thirds of the way between the second and third cataracts of the river. This reach was also a significant area for the Kerma society. The Island of Sai was located here. Sai was the centre of Shaat, in other words, the major area of trade and Kerma culture in the area. There were three branches flowing from the Nile through the Dongola area. Due to the coupling with the yearly inundation of the river, this area was exceptionally abundant with alluvial deposits which made it ideal for successful farming, animal husbandry, cattle grazing, and human settlement. Though today these river branches are dried up, they would have created a large basin area of fertile land now called the Kerma Basin. 
Ideally placed in such an advantageous spot of Africa, Kemra had become the leader of trade within the continent. </p>

<h3>Site Description</h3>
<hr>
<p>The actual site of Kerma has two substantial formations constructed of mud and brick. These structures are known as Deffufa's i.e. large brick structures. The Western Deffufa (sometimes referred to as the Lower Deffufa) is an estimated mile and a half from the banks of the Nile and Eastern Deffufa (sometimes referred to as the Upper Deffufa) is about two miles east of the riverbank, located in the burial grounds of Kerma.

The Western Deffufa is a big, durable mud-brick mass with not interior rooms. It is an unusual structure with its tapered staircase following the outermost edges of the flat-topped structure. The only are that could be considered a room is a 12 x 15 foot landing. This landing appears at the very first turn off of the stairway and has been deemed a guardroom. Despite being named, it is unknown what this space in the Western Deffufa was actually used for. The complicated brickwork and usage of wood frames conveys that the construction of this Deffufa had heavy Egyptian influences. The knowledge of the Egyptians having a hand in the building of the Western Deffufa is undisputed, whether for supervisory purposes or not. The surrounding land is flat with no mountains or hills, one can view long distances without obstruction.

The Eastern Deffufa is located in the southeastern most part of Kerma. It is theorized that the structure was once one of two, twins in other words, identical in both design and height. George Reisner, an archaeologist who excavated the site from 1913-1914, suggested that the structure and its twin were working mortuary buildings due to being built to the north of one of the largest burial mounds in the city. These tumuli (burial mounds) were stationed at the southern border of the cemetery. The structure was obviously built with height in mind, it had two internal rooms with black, red, and yellow painted Egyptian-styled murals on the encompassing walls. Each of the two rooms has four columns placed in a vertical line. Said columns went through the very center of the structure, they were supported by cross beams constructed of timber. Though it is unknown what the actual structure's purpose was, the height suggests it could have been utilized as a lookout station to protect the human remains in the large necropolis.

The cemetery in which the Deffufa's were stationed contained thousands of burials. The tomb holder of the biggest gravesite is theorized to have been an extremely wealthy and power individual in Kerma society. This inference was reached due to the sheer size and number of buried sacrificed individuals, both humand and animal, being an indicative factor of societal status. The tomb is almost 300 feet in width, while containing 300 to 400 human sacrificial burials. George Reisner, the previously mentioned archaeologist, divided these burials into four categories: great mounds, minor mounds, independent grave sites, and subsidiary burials.
