      <h1>Karnak - Precinct of Mut</h1>
      <h3>18th Dynasty - Ptolemaic Period</h3>

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The Precinct of Mut is a temple complex in the larger Karnak temple complex in modern day Luxor (ancient Thebes). It was dedicated to the Goddess Mut, who was a protector goddess, wife to the God Amun, and mother of the moon god Khonsu. She often appeared in the form of Sekhmet, a female deity with the head of a lion, whom a great many statues have been found at the cite. The earliest datable remains at the cite date to shared reign of Hatshepsut and her nephew/step-son, Thutmose III during the 18th dynasty. The site was added to by many successive Pharaohs, and into the Ptolemaic Period. 
         <br>
         <br>
         In addition the main Mut Temple, the complex also houses a another large tempel, called Temple A, and large chapel, a temple built by Ramasses III, a gateway named by its builder, King Taharqa, and other small temples and statues. </p>

         <h3>Location</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>The Precinct of Mut is located in what was the ancient city of Thebes, which is mostly cobered by the modern city of Luxor.
         <br>
         <br>
         The Precinct of Mut is located a hundred yards south of the Temple of Amun, which the complex faces. In addition, the two complexes are connected by a long avenue of Sphinxs. Around the Mut Temple itself is a large lake called Isheru, which is sacred to a group of goddesses to which Mut belongs, called the Eye of Re.</p>

         <h3>Description of Site</h3>
         <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p> 
         The Precinct of Mut is located in southern Karnak, a hundred yards from the Temple of Amun, which the complex faces. In addition, the two complexes are connected by a long avenue of Sphinxs. Around the Mut Temple itself is a large lake called Isheru, which is sacred to a group of goddesses to which Mut belongs, called the Eye of Re (Brooklyn Museum). The site is unique in its dedication to these goddesses, and in the large number of statues found there (Mut in Asher). 
         <br>
         <br>
         The entrance to the Precinct is home to a large gateway called The Propylon, which was incribed for two Ptolemaic Kings, Ptolemy II and Ptolemy VI. It contains a number of depictions of the Goddess Mut and her worshippers (Brooklyn Museum) 
         <br>
         <br>
         The earliest remains of buildings date to the reign of Hatshepsut and her successor Thutmose III, though there may have been a temple on the site in the Middle Kingdom (Brooklyn Museum). The earliest expedition to the site uncovered what they believed to be a figure representing the 11th Dynasty king Amenemhat I (Mut in Asher). The site continued to be added to until the 30th Dynasty or the reigns of the Ptolemaic kings (Brooklyn Museum). 
         <br>
         <br>
         The Temple of Mut, as part of the Karnak complex, was a religious mainstay through dynasty after dynasty. During the reign of Thutmose III, the Temple saw many of its reliefs portraying her destroyed as part of his larger campaign of destruction against his step-mother (UCLA).

         <h3>Excavations</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
         <p>  
         The earliest modern visitors to the site include Napolean and his team of scientist during his invasion of Egypt in 1798, and they produced a fairly accurate map of the site. (Brooklyn Museum). The first Archaeologists to conduct excavations at the site were two women, Margaret Benson and her friend Janet Gourlay, who published thier findings in The City of Mut in Asher (Brooklyn Museum). They began their excavation in 1895, and employed many local workers to help clear the temple (Mut in Asher). The Temple was in disrepair, and in addition to excavating the site in order to learn its history, they also hoped to leave it in better shape then it had been (Mut in Asher). They also were searching for a number of statuettes that they believed could be found there (Mut in Asher). During the three years they worked in the Precinct they managed to clear two courtyards and one of the temples (Female Statues). This excavation granted Benson the privelage of being the first woman awarded her own site in Egypt by the Egyptian government (Female Statues).
         <b>
         <b>
         The next person to conduct work at the site was Maurice Pillet, Director of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization (Brooklyn Museum). He excavated Temple A and the Temple of Rameses III (Brooklyn Museum).
         <br>
         <br>
         In 1975 the Serge Sauneron of the Institut Francais dâ€™Archeologie conducted work on the entrance propylon, which dated from the time of the Ptolemies (Female Statues).
         <br>
         <br>
         The current excavations being conducted at the Precinct began in 1976 under the guidance of Richard Fazzini of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and assisted by the Detroit Institute of Art (Female Statues).
